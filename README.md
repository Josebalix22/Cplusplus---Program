When approaching software design, I begin by fully understanding the problem and breaking it into modular components. Each component is mapped out logically and visually to ensure smooth interaction with the rest of the system. Through this process, I have gained valuable skills in creating reusable systems for scene management, texture handling, and shader control, while also learning how to focus on visual polish and user experience. My design process relies on iterative prototyping: starting with basic functionality, then gradually layering in aesthetics, physics, and interactivity. Looking forward, I see these strategies particularly modular design, visual feedback loops, and automation as adaptable to any scalable system, whether in graphics, simulation, or broader computer science applications.

Developing Programs

In the development phase, I applied structured strategies to maintain clarity and efficiency. For example, I used batch scripting to automate asset preparation and texture conversion, while keeping my OpenGL code organized with a clear separation of logic and rendering. Iteration played a central role: by refining lighting, camera movement, and collision handling step by step, I ensured each feature was tested and improved before moving on. Over time, my approach evolved from trial and error coding to a more disciplined workflow that emphasized debugging, refactoring, and test-driven thinking. This shift not only improved performance but also strengthened the clarity and maintainability of my programs.

Computer Science and My Goals

Studying computational graphics has shown me how math, physics, and code combine to create interactive, real time visuals. This experience will benefit me in advanced computer science courses and in simulation based learning, where precision and scalability are essential. 
Professionally, these skills align closely with my long term goal of working for the IT organizations, where systems thinking, technical precision, and visual analysis are critical for roles involving surveillance, logistics, and technical operations. My academic journey has helped me build both the problem-solving mindset and the technical foundation needed to achieve these goals.
